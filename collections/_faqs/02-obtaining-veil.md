There are, in principle, four primary ways to obtain Veil:

- You can mine Veil via its Proof-of-Work consensus system.
- You can purchase Veil on a centralized or decentralized exchange.
- You earn Veil by “staking” it in your wallet.
- You can perform “bounty” work for the project, receiving Veil as compensation.
