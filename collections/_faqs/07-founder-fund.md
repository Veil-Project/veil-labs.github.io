In order to avoid an ICO and pre-mine, the Veil project has been pre-funded in excess of one million USD by its founder. As a mechanism to recover this investment, a founder's reward is established, which tapers and expires over a five-year period.

The operations budget is established to fund the team (currently over 30 individuals), and the Labs budget is established to fund ongoing research and development in the areas of advanced cryptography and blockchain technologies.
