title: What makes Veil different from other Zerocoin-based coins?
ref: veil_different

All other Zerocoin-based privacy coins have a transparent (public) “Basecoin” layer, meaning a user can inadvertently make a non-private transaction. Veil secures its Basecoin layer with RingCT, providing always-on full-time privacy for its users.

Another key difference is that the Zerocoin deterministic wallet will be integrated with Bitcoin Improvement Proposals 39 and 44 (BIP39/44). The seed for both the Zerocoin wallet and Basecoin wallet will be the same, requiring users to only backup a single seed. This stands in contrast to many other Zerocoin-based coins that either have a seperate backup seed for their Zerocoins, or none at all.
