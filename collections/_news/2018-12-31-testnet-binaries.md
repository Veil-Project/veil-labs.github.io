title: Veil Testnet Ready — Binaries Released
description: 'Veil wallet source code and pre-release build and mining software builds available for public testing and review.'
---

The Veil testnet and mining software are now ready for public testing! Get up close and personal with the pre-release build of the Veil wallet and release build mining software.

To ensure everything goes as planned, Veil’s cutting edge peer-to-peer network is undergoing intensive testing and will now be open for public testing. The newly available binaries will allow our community to test and review Veil’s wallet and blockchain features.

## What do I have access to?

- Veil wallet source code
- Veil wallet pre-release binaries on all major desktop platforms
- Suprminer and WildRig mining software release builds

## Where can I see the source code?

The source code can be accessed in the [Veil GitHub public repository](https://github.com/Veil-Project/veil).

## How do I start testing?

1. Download the correct binary for your operating system (Linux, Windows, and macOS available) from [Veil Github Releases](https://github.com/Veil-Project/veil/releases). Install and follow first-run setup.

2. Enable Testnet mode by going to Settings icon > Preferences, and at the bottom left of the pop-up click “Open Configuration File” and enter the following into the notepad file before saving and exiting: testnet=1

3. If you have no connection to peers, go to Settings icon > Advanced Options > Peers tab and block peers for an hour. Click the Console tab and enter the following: addnode veil.suprnova.cc add


Pre-registration is also available for x16rt mining on [Suprnova](https://veil.suprnova.cc/index.php?page=gettingstarted). For those interested in testing mining, [Suprminer 2.0 miner](https://github.com/ocminer/suprminer/releases) for NVIDIA cards and [WildRig Multi miner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5023676) (may release later today) for AMD graphics cards will let you test mining on the Suprnova pool.

Special thanks to OCminer of Suprnova and Andrucrypt from WildRig for making NVIDIA and AMD x16rt support possible!
