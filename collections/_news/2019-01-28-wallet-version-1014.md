The Veil development team have just released version 1.0.1.4 of the Veil Core Wallet. All users are recommended to [upgrade immediately](https://github.com/Veil-Project/veil/releases).

Improvements in this version include:

- Quicker recognition of orphans and forks.
- Denomination filter when using spendzerocoin rpc. Allows the user to specify a specific zerocoin denomination to spend with. For example if someone wants to spend 10 denoms into 100's they would want to apply a 10 filter.
- Stake miner will not stall if it is "close enough" to the chain tip.
- Reduce stake miner's tendency to produce redundant stakes.

As always, we encourage Veil users to keep an eye on our [changelog page](https://veil-project.com/changelog/) for a summary of all major issues of which users should be aware.

Best regards,

The Veil Team
