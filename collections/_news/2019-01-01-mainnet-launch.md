Having worked non-stop since August 2018, the team at Veil Project couldn’t be more excited to announce that **as of January 1, 2019 the Veil Mainnet has officially launched!**.

Although there is still much work to be done:

- You can [download the core wallet for Linux, Windows and MacOS X](https://veil-project.com/get-started/) immediately.

- You can [download miner software](https://veil-project.com/mining/) for NVIDIA and AMD, and [start mining at one of the available pools](https://veil-project.com/mining/).

**Important** — While all wallet issues are canonically tracked in GitHub Issues are of our repository, there is a condensed list of the most important issues new users should be aware of in our [Changelog document](/changelog/). Be sure to review this list before downloading and installing the wallet.

We’ll have more announcements and documentation online soon, but as always, if you need any support, don’t hesitate to reach out in the [Official Veil Discord](https://discord.veil-project.com).

Best regards,

The Veil Team
