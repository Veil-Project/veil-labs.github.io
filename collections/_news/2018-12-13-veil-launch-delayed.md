description: 'To allow for additional public testing, Veil will launch on Jan 1, 2019'

After discussions with our team and community, the Veil Project has decided to postpone the Mainnet launch until January 1, 2019, to allow further time to validate our fair distribution model.

In that regard, we will be establishing an open and public test network, accessible to all parties interested in the project. As part of this effort, we are also allocating additional resources to further document the x16rt mining algorithm, in order to ensure that everyone planning to participate in the initial mining are fully supported in terms of available information.

We thank you for your patience, and appreciate your understanding that while everyone would love for Veil to launch as early as possible, quality and fairness are the highest priorities.
