## Hi My Name Is… 

My name is Lori Brown and I am thankful to have spent the last few years exploring my passion for cryptocurrency while documenting the journey in news, blogs and various writing projects. Things became interesting when a unique opportunity presented itself while I was traveling to a distant convention. 

## All Signs Pointed To Veil

While traveling to the city of Seoul, in South Korea, thousands of miles from my home in Las Vegas,  I learned  of a privacy coin called Veil, and it really caught my attention.  Ironically I found that the creators of this fascinating coin-in-the-making were also from Las Vegas. 

Upon returning home I dug into work as usual. While checking my LinkedIn messages, I saw a familiar face. I had received a message from an old friend that I had lost contact with over the years. His message started with a hint of skepticism that I didn’t yet understand. “Ok... What’s up chicky?” 

Confusion was my initial reaction. We had not spoken for years, so I wasn’t yet aware of the reason for his contact. My confusion then changed to surprise as I continued reading. My old friend James just happened to be the creator of PIVX, the coin for which I was conducting an upcoming interview. Wow. Small world, right? Then I became even further mystified when James informed me that he was also the creator of The Veil Project, the very same coin which I had grown fascinated by during my recent travels. My mind was blown. After explaining that I had been writing for the last few years and sharing some recent work, I was offered a chance to join the Veil team.

## I Accepted The Challenge

Although some of the subject matter is more advanced than any project I have written about, I am here because all signs pointed to Veil. It is not often that someone needs to travel across the globe to find a great job around the corner from home. Laugh if you want to, but with all of the unlikely circumstances leading to the moment I was in, I figured it was the universe showing me the path to my destiny.  

## Welcome To Lori’s Corner. 

I invite you to follow along, stay tuned, and participate if you so desire. We will get to explore the intricate details of Veil piece by piece, sifting through everything from development to team personalities. I look forward to expanding on this unique opportunity as we unravel the mysteries of Veil technologies together. Cheers.

## PS
Special thanks to the entire team for all your hard work and thanks for letting me be me. The views expressed in Lori’s corner will not always reflect the views of Veil. Opinion is that of the writer.
