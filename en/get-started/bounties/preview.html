      <li class="mb-3"><strong>Availability</strong> — Only tasks that are in the state <strong>available</strong> are available to be picked up for development. Tasks in other states have already been accepted and are being worked on. </li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong>Application</strong> — If you intend to work on an available task, post a note on the GitHub Issue, tagging the developer <strong>@presstab</strong>, and include an initial description of your approach to addressing the task.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong>Assignment</strong> — If your proposed approach is accepted, @presstab will make a note of that on the GitHub Issue, and will change the state to <strong>assigned</strong>.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong>Interaction</strong> — As you work on the task, you can post questions and feedback as notes on the issue.

      <li class="mb-3"><strong>Progress</strong> — As the state of work progresses, you should tag @presstab in a note, requesting to update the state of work. The available states are: <strong>assigned</strong>, <strong>analysis</strong>, <strong>development</strong>, <strong>integration</strong>, <strong>testing</strong> and <strong>completed</strong>.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong>Completion & Payment</strong> — Once a task has been successfully completed, you will be paid the bounty in Veil.</li>
