title: Get the Veil Wallet
---
When the Veil mainnet launches on Jan 1, 2019, this page will contain download links to signed releases for our core wallet, built for **Windows**, **Mac OS X** and **Linux**. These wallets will allow Veil users to earn rewards through staking, and their release will include usage documentation.

In addition, we will provide **paper wallet generators** for both the mainnet and testnet. While these generators can run online and offline, as a privacy-centric project, our recommendation will be to download and run them **locally**.

After the release of our core wallets, we'll turn our focus to **mobile wallets** for **Android** and **iOS**, and the exploration of integration with common **hardware wallets**â€”such as **Ledger** and **Trezor**.

Finally, integration with hardware wallets will be followed by work from the Veil Labs in an area called **delegated staking**, allowing Veil users to stake their coins from the security of a hardware wallet.
