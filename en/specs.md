The following table captures the detailed technical specifications relevant to Veil and its network.

| Development Data | |

| Codebase | Bitcoin Core version 0.17.1 |
| Supported OSs | Windows, macOS, Linux, paper wallet |
| Source Model | Open Source |
| License | MIT License |

| Blockchain Data | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Concensus Mechanism | Hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake model. | 
| Proof-of-Work | [X16RT Mining Algorithm](/faqs/#x16rt) |
| Proof-of-Stake | Exclusively with Zerocoin. | 
| Block time | 60 seconds, retargeting every block. |
| Block Schedule | Block rewards will stop in approximately 2037, when a max coin supply of 300 million VEIL is reached. After this hard cap is reached, network fees will continue to incentivize the network. | 
| Transaction Fees | Variable based on data size.  |
| Privacy Technology | Veil uses mandatory RingCT+stealth addresses to anonymize the Basecoin layer. When 10 or more Basecoin Veil is deposited to a wallet, it will be autominted into Zerocoin Veil. |
| [Dandelion](/faqs/#dandelion) | Veil will use multiple stems, rather than one, to increase the level of IP anonymity and privacy. Inspired by BIP 156. |


| Zerocoin | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zerocoin Mint fee | Fixed to start, then variable at a later date.  |
| Full-time Autominting | All available balances are automatically converted to Zerocoin Veil with certain exceptions. Exceptions may be special use cases for exchanges and other services as well as a designated Basecoin address for each user where Basecoin Veil will not be automatically converted into Zerocoin Veil. |
| Multi-Transaction Zerocoin Spending | This allows a transaction to be spread over multiple blocks. Since Zerocoin spending is computationally expensive, only up to 20 Zerocoin denominations can be sent at once in a single transaction. If 21 or more Zerocoin denominations are being sent in one transaction, it is automatically split into two or more transactions by the Multi-Transaction Zerocoin spend feature. |
| Precomputed Zerocoin Spends for Faster Spending | Veil precomputes Zerocoin spends, which automatically processes spend data in the background and stores it in a database so that when a user decides to spend their coins, there is less computation involved.|
| Bulletproofs | Without Bulletproofs, Zerocoin spend sizes are over 20 kilobytes, but with the implementation of Bulletproofs, we now have the Zerocoin spend sizes down to ~11.3 kilobytes. This makes for cheaper transactions. With Veil Labs, a major goal is to reduce this figure even further. |


| Miscellaneous | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wallet Backup | The Zerocoin deterministic wallet will be integrated with Bitcoin Improvement Proposals 39 and 44 (BIP 39/44). The seed for both the Zerocoin wallet and Basecoin wallet will be the same, requiring users to only backup a single seed. |
