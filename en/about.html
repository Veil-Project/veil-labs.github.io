        Veil Labs is an entity established by the Veil Project, with its own budget, mission and team. Its purpose is to conduct research and development, and push the technical boundaries in the domains of cryptography, privacy and blockchain technologies.
      </p>

      <p>As tested and vetted theories emerge from the Labs, the Veil Project will be the first adopter, in an effort to maintain its competitive advantage as a market leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency. That said, our aspirations stretch far beyond Veil, to the broader crypto community, as we encourage other projects to adopt these innovations, pushing the space ahead as a whole.</p>

      <p>With a professional team of cryptographers and developers, combined with key partnerships with leading academic institutions, Veil Labs is proud to take on this critical role in the blockchain industry.</p>
      
      <h2 class="uppercase text-lg font-bold">About the Veil Project</h2>
      
      <p>The Veil Project was conceived in early 2018 by James Burden, a recognized industry expert in crypto-privacy and holding a track record of founding and leading successful cryptocurrency projects like PIVX. The motivation for the project was recognition of the need for a currency that provided full-time privacy without compromising strength of anonymity.</p>
      
      <p>
        With seed funding in excess of one million USD, a team of leading blockchain developers, including the well-respected Presstab, user experience experts and operations personnel was formed. Development started in August 2018, with the project's mainnet launched in January, 2019.
