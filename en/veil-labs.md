**Veil Labs** is an entity established by the Veil Project, with its own budget, mission and team. Its purpose is to conduct **research and development**, and push the technical boundaries in the domains of **cryptography**, **privacy** and **blockchain technologies**.

As tested and vetted theories emerge from the Labs, the Veil Project will be the first adopter, in an effort to maintain its competitive advantage as a **market leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency**.
