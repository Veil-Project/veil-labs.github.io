    en: 'In the current “let’s regulate crypto” environment, we can’t lose sight of what makes crypto revolutionary to begin with—it has to stay permissionless and fungible. Privacy of use is a critical extension of fungibility and safety to  users. Veil is pushing this ethos forward, and has my full support.'

    en: 'The virtues of crypto lie in anonymity. Not so much for fear of retribution but just for the privacy’s. The right to conceal and keep what is yours, yours. The Veil team is not simply looking to market privacy, but actually implement and achieve it. For those who need it.'
